### A crashcourse on the files used in here so as to develop a better understanding for the readers ###

1. what is a pyproject.toml file?

TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language): It's a simple configuration file format (like JSON or YAML) but is easier to 
read and write. TOML is becoming the standard for packaginf Python metadata.

2. Why pyproject.toml is important?

> It was introduced with PEP 518 to modernize Pyhton package building. Previously, everything was done by setup.py
  but now pyproject.toml allows for more flexibility, better dependency management, and cleaner project configuration.
> It cenralizes metadata about the project: project name, version, dependencies, authors etc.
> It supports various build systems (like setuptools, poetry, etc.).

3. Explaining sections of pyproject.toml:

[project]: Defines the basic porject information (name, version, description, authors).
[tools.setuptools]: Specifies that setuptools is being used to build the project.
[tools.setuptools.dynamic]: Link the external files (like requirements.txt) to dynamically pull dependencies.

4. setup.py with the advent of pyproject.toml: Some tasks previously handled by setup.py (like metadata) are
   now managed by pyproject.toml. However, setup.py can still be used, especially is you have complex build steps.

5. How do setup.py, pyproject.toml and requirements.txt work together?

> pyproject.toml: It's now the central place for project metadata. Instead of defining your dependencies
  and project information in setup.py, you can define them in pyproject.toml.
  As we did in our project, the line [tool.setuptools.dynamic] dependencies = {file = 'requirements.txt'} links
  your requirements.txt the TOML file, so when the project is built, the dependencies are feteched from 
  requirements.txt

> setup.py: While it's still used for custom builds and configurations, most of the basic functionality
  (like metadata and dependencies) is being transferred to pyproject.toml. We might still keep a minimal
  setup.py if we have custom build steps, but for most projects it is not necessary anymore with the 
  advent of pyproject.toml.

> requirements.txt: It lists all projects dependencies and their versions.

When we run "pip install -r requirements.txt", it ensures that all dependencies are installed. The 
pyproject.toml file can reference it (as we did in our project) so that package dependencies are
pulled from there.
